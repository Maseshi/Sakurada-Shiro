- Skins are currently not supported in mania, catch, taiko modes, which will be rendered as default skins instead.
- Resolutions of 16:10 screens are not yet supported, where skins may not display properly.
- Skins are not yet supported for those who have [osu!supporter](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/support) full
